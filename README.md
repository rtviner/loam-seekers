This is a photo and video journal of my road trip and mountain biking adventures starting with a road trip from Colorado to British Columbia I completed with my partner in 2016.

The journal is organized by state/province rather than date because the experiences matter more than the timeline.  

Navigate through the journal by clicking on a state/province image on the map or clicking on the state/province name in the navigation bar. In some states/provinces we rode in multiple places so there is a secondary nav bar with more specific locations.  Click on a location name to jump to the photos and videos from that specific location.
