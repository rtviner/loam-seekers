# Loam Seekers

Description
-----------
This is a photo and video journal of my road trip and mountain biking adventures starting with a road trip from Colorado to British Columbia I completed with my partner in 2016.

The journal is organized by state/province rather than date because the experiences matter more than the timeline.  

This website was created using CSS and HTML and is designed to render well across devices and screen sizes.

How To Use
-----------
This website can be viewed at https://rtviner.github.io/loam-seekers/index.html

Navigate through the journal by clicking on a state/province image on the map or clicking on the state/province name in the navigation bar. In some states/provinces we rode in multiple places so there is a secondary nav bar with more specific locations.  Click on a location name to jump to the photos and videos from that specific location.

Notes
------
This website used CSS grid and flexbox techniques as well as image source sets to improve the look and user experience on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
