		    	<p class="long-cap"> Days 27, 28, and 29 were actually spent in Idaho and Wyoming. We met up with some folks from Colorado who now call Victor Idaho home. They were kind enough to show us the famous Teton Pass Trails. These were some of the first one-way mountain bike only trails in the country and they are gnarly yet incredibly fun. Thank you Teton Freedom Riders for all your hard work!
